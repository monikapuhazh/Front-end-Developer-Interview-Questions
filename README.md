# Front-end Job Interview Questions

This file contains a number of front-end interview questions that can be used when vetting potential candidates. It is by no means recommended to use every single question here on the same candidate (that would take hours). Choosing a few items from this list should help you vet the intended skills you require.

**Note:** Keep in mind that many of these questions are open-ended and could lead to interesting discussions that tell you more about the person's capabilities than a straight answer would.

#### General Questions:

* What did you learn yesterday/this week?
  - Technical challenge  
  - Design pattern  
  - Performance optimization  
* What excites or interests you about coding?
  - Unlimited possibilities of what we can do with technology  
  - Designing, evaluating and improving on software architecture 
* What is a recent technical challenge you experienced and how did you solve it?
  - Integrating with a third-party SSO service
  - Replacing cookies approach with a more secure one using API authentication
* What UI, Security, Performance, SEO, Maintainability or Technology considerations do you make while building a web application or site?
* Talk about your preferred development environment.
* Which version control systems are you familiar with?
* Can you describe your workflow when you create a web page?
* If you have 5 different stylesheets, how would you best integrate them into the site?
* Can you describe the difference between progressive enhancement and graceful degradation?
  - Graceful degradation is the practice of building web functionality such that it provides a complex UX for users of modern browsers but gracefully degrades to a lower level of UX for older browsers.
  - Progressive enhancement is the process in reverse - starting with a minimal set of functionality supported by all browsers and then adding further layers that wil add more/better functionality to browsers that can handle it 
* How would you optimize a website's assets/resources?
  - Images - use sprites for icons
  - CSS/JS
    - Minify - maintains valid code like removing white space, removing comments, removing redundant semicolons, 
    - Obfuscate - includes minification, additionally renames variables, functions, etc to use shorter identifier names
    - Compres(gzip) - Locates repetitive strings and replaces them with pointers to first instance of that string 
* How many resources will a browser download from a given domain at a time? What are the exceptions?
  - Firefox 2:  2
  - Firefox 3+: 6
  - Opera 9.26: 4
  - Opera 12:   6
  - Safari 3:   4
  - Safari 5:   6
  - IE 7:       2
  - IE 8:       6
  - IE 10:      8
  - Chrome:     6
* Name 3 ways to decrease page load (perceived or actual load time).
* If you jumped on a project and they used tabs and you used spaces, what would you do?
* Describe how you would create a simple slideshow page.
* If you could master one technology this year, what would it be?
* Explain the importance of standards and standards bodies.
* What is Flash of Unstyled Content? How do you avoid FOUC?
  - FOUC is the brief display of a website before CSS styles are applies
  - Simplest way is to include the <link> tags within the <head></head> tags
    - Avoids FOUC
    - Reduces page load time since browser doesn't need to re-render the FOUC page after loading of CSS
* Explain what ARIA and screenreaders are, and how to make a website accessible.
  - Screenreaders allow people with visual impairment to access websites. Uses Text-To-Speech engine to translate on-screen information into speech or an external hardware device (refreshable Braille display)
  - ARIA (Accessible Rich Internet Applications) makes website accessible to people with visual impairment. Use "role", "aria-hidden", etc. attributes
* Explain some of the pros and cons for CSS animations versus JavaScript animations. (**TRY [THIS](https://css-tricks.com/myth-busting-css-animations-vs-javascript/) OUT!**)
  - Cons
    - Single transform property, lack of independent control to scale, rotation, position
    - Workflow - have to think in terms of %, not time
* What does CORS stand for and what issue does it address?
  - CORS is cross-origin resource sharing. Mechanism that uses additional HTTP headers to let a user agent gain permission to access selected resources from a server on a different domain than the current site. 
  - Simple request: If the resource requested by client is allowed to be shared across domains by that server, then server returns Access-Control-Allow-Origin header in its response. The value could be * to indicate any domain can access it or it can mention the specific domain. The server knows where the request is coming based on the ORIGIN header in the request.
  - Preflighted request: Request is preflighted if for instnace, it is one of PUT, DELETE, CONNECT, OPTIONS, TRACE or PATCH or if the request content type is JSON, etc. In this case browser will first send an OPTIONS request to the server to check if the client is allowed access to that resource. If the server responds with the appropriate value for Access-Control-Cross-Origin header, it then sends the actual request.
* What is a browser user agent?
  - Used to identify the browser product (Chrome, Mozilla, IE, Safari, etc) and the OS (Windows, Linux, Android, etc) from which the request is originating
  - Used by the web server 
    - To serve different versions of pages based on what that browser supports
    - To server more optimal version based on OS
    - Gather data on browser and OS in use by users
  - User Agent syntax: `User-Agent: <product> / <product-version> <comment>`
  - User agents are also used by web crawler bots to identify themseleves, they might be allowed to bypass some registration screens
  - Server can use robots.txt file to restrict or allow a bot access to read/index certain areas of the website
* About HTTP/2
  - One constant connection between browser and server to transfer data instead of multiple separate connections for transferring different components of the web page like HTML, JS, CSS, etc. 
  - Transfers information in binary instead of text - reduces translation time
  - Multiplexing - sending and receiving multiple messages at the same time. Browser can send multiple requests for data over single TCP connection, so for example 3 different JS files can be downloaded via async mode from 1 server simultaneously
  - Prioritization - transfer important data first
  - Header compression HPACK
  - Server push - server makes educated guess about what the next request from client will be and sends data ahead of time
  - ALPN extension - allows for faster encrypted connections
  - Reduced RTT - reduces round trip times
  - Domain sharding and asset concantenation are no longer needed
